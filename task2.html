             <p>These soft Onion Pakodis are being sold at almost every street corner in the Andhra and Rayalaseema regions. Onion Pakodi comes in different varieties. Interestingly the ingredients for any type of Onion Pakodi may be the same. The difference comes in the way the batter is mixed and the way it is fried. These two factors make for a world of difference!!/>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <h3>
                How to grate onion:</h3>
                <p>The Onions should not be sliced thin for this Pakodi. Rather, chop them into slightly thick roundel. The thick Onion bits get soft and juicy when they are deep- fried in oil.</p>
            <h3>
                One essential Ingredient:</h3> 
                <p>Ghee is an important ingredient to make good, fluffy, light Pakodis. Roadside food vendors generally use Dalda ghee or hydrogenated vegetable oil. Ghee is any time a healthy, tastier and authentic traditional option.</p>
            <h3>How to get perfect Pakodis:</h3>
            <p>As soon as water is added to the flour, it should be whisked really well until the batter becomes light and airy. Otherwise, the Pakodis will be hard at the core though they may appear to be well- fried on top. The taste is not at all good; and definitely that is not how Andhra Special Pakodi should be.</p>
               <h3>How to fry the Pakodis:</h3> 
               <ul>
                <li>When Pakodi is dropped in the hot oil, it should first sink into the Kadai. Otherwise the Pakodis will come out flat. Once the Pakodis have been lowered into the oil, let them remain untouched for 2 minutes. The flour will cook properly, and bind well on to the onion. Otherwise, the onion and the flour will separate and the Pakodis will disintegrate.</li>
               </ul>
               <ul>
                <li>Pakodis should always be fried on a medium flame. In this way, the Pakodis will be crispy on the outside; and soft and light on the inside.</li>
               </ul>
